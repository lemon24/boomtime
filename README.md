**boomtime** is a single-user calendar application.

Goals:

* command-line interface for humans
* clearly documented API, so it can be used as backend for other intefaces

The number of concepts exposed to the user should be kept to a minimum. Doing
less to achieve this is encouraged.

Development should follow a [problem-solution][] approach.

In scope:

* events
    * title/description
    * all-day events
    * (later) reminders
* (later) special calendars (birthdays, holidays)
* (much later) todos
